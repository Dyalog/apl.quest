<div id="P1_It_Is_All_Right" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 1: It Is All Right

Write a function that takes the length of the legs of a triangle as its left argument, and the length of the
hypotenuse as its right argument and returns 1 if the triangle is a right triangle, 0 otherwise.

### Examples:

```APL
      3 4 (your_function) 5
1
      2 3 (your_function) 4
0
```

</div>

<div id="P2_How_Tweet_It_Is" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 2: How Tweet It Is

Twitter messages have a 140 character limit; what if the limit was even shorter? One way to shorten the
message yet retain most readability is to remove interior vowels from its words. Write a function which takes a
character vector and removes the interior vowels from each word.

### Examples:

```APL
      (your_function) 'if you can read this, it worked!'
if yu cn rd ths, it wrkd!
      (your_function) 'APL is REALLY cool'
APL is RLLY cl
      (your_function) '' ⍝ an empty vector arg should return an empty vector
 
      (your_function) 'a' ⍝ should work with a single character message
a
```

</div>

<div id="P3_Tell_a_Fib" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 3: Tell a Fib

Write a function that takes an integer right argument and returns that number of terms in the Fibonacci
sequence.

### Examples:

```APL
      (your_function) 10
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
      (your_function) 1
1
      (your_function) 0 ⍝ should return an empty vector
```

</div>

<div id="P4_Space_The_Final_Frontier" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 4: Space The Final Frontier

Write a function that removes extraneous (leading, trailing, and multiple) spaces from a character vector.

### Examples:

```APL
      (your_function) '  this  is a   test  '
this is a test
       (your_function) '' ⍝ should return an empty vector
 
       (your_function) 'hello world!'
hello world!
       (your_function) '  ' ⍝ vector of only spaces should return empty vector
```

</div>

<div id="P5_Mirror_Mirror" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 5: Mirror Mirror

A palindrome is a word or phrase whose letters read the same forwards and backwards. Write a function which
returns a 1 if its character vector argument is a palindrome, 0 otherwise. For simplicity's sake, you may
assume that the vector is all one case.

### Examples:

```APL
      (your_function) 'a man, a plan, a canal, panama!'
1
      (your_function) '' ⍝ a phrase of 0 length is a palindrome
1
      (your_function) 'a' ⍝ as is a single letter phrase
1
      (your_function) 'APL' ⍝ APL may be cool, but it's not a palindrome
0
```

</div>

<div id="P6_Roll_The_Dice" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 6: Roll The Dice

Write a function that takes an integer vector representing the sides of a number of dice and returns a 2 column
matrix of the number of ways each possible total of the dice can be rolled.

### Examples:

```APL
      (your_function) 6 6 ⍝ 2 six-sided dice
2 1
3 2
4 3
5 4
6 5
7 6
8 5
9 4
10 3
11 2
12 1
      (your_function) 6 4 ⍝ a six-sided and a four-sided die
2 1
3 2
4 3
5 4
6 4
7 4
8 3
9 2
10 1
      (your_function) 3 ⍝ a single 3-sided die
1 1
2 1
3 1
      (your_function) ⍬ ⍝ no dice
0 1
```

</div>

<div id="P7_Revolutionary_Thinking" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 7: Revolutionary Thinking

Imagine there are two circles that are tangent to one another. One circle is stationary, the other can "roll"
around the stationary circle.


<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/2014 circles image.PNG" style="width:30vw" class="fi">
</div>


Write a function which takes the diameters of the stationary and mobile circles and returns the number of
revolutions the mobile must traverse until the tangent points meet again.

### Examples:

```APL
      10 (your_function) 10 ⍝ identically sized circles
1
      10 (your_function) 5 ⍝ a mobile circle that's half the size needs to make 2 revolutions
2
      5 (your_function) 7 ⍝ a mobile circle of diameter 7 needs to make 5 revolutions around a stationary circle of diameter 5
5
```

</div>

<div id="P8_Go_The_Distance" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 8: Go The Distance

Write a function that returns the distance between two points in a space of any number of dimensions.

### Examples:

```APL
      2 (your_function) 5 ⍝ one-dimensional space
3
      2 2 (your_function) 5 6 ⍝ two-dimensional space
5
      ⍬ (your_function) ⍬ ⍝ zero dimension space
0
      2 2 3 4 (your_function) 3 7 10 9 ⍝ four-dimensions
10
```

<div id="P9_Going_Ballistic" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 9: Going Ballistic

The following formula gives the horizontal distance a projectile travels:

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/2014.9 formula.svg" style="width:10vw" class="fi">
</div>


Where: v is the initial velocity, θ is the trajectory in degrees, d is the horizontal distance and G is the gravitational constant.

Write a function which calculates the distance (in meters) a projectile travels given an initial velocity in meters
per second and a trajectory in degrees. Use 9.8 meters per second squared as the gravitational constant.


### Examples:

```APL
      100 (your_function) 45 ⍝ 100 meters per second and 45 degree trajectory
1020.408163
      0 (your_function) 45 ⍝ no velocity = no distance
0
      100 (your_function) 90 ⍝ shooting straight up = no distance

<div id="P10_Sales_Are_Up" class="problem" markdown="1">

# 10: Sales Are Up

Given a vector representing monthly sales figures, write a function that returns the greatest percent month to
month increase.

### Examples:

```APL
