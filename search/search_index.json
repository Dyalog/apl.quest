One common representation for a key/value pair is to have a character key (name) followed by an equals sign (=) followed by the value. Multiple key/value pairs can be separated by a delimiter character or characters. For example:</p> <pre>\n      key1=value1;key2=value2\n</pre> <p>Write a function that:</p> <ul> <li>takes a 2-element character vector left argument where the first element represents the separator character between multiple key/value pairs and the second element represents the separator between the key and the value for each pair.</li> <li>takes a character vector right argument representing a valid set of key/value pairs (delimited as specified by the left argument).</li> <li>returns a 2-column matrix where the first column contains the character vector keys of the key/value pairs and the second column contains the character vector values.</li> </ul> <p>Note: You may assume that there will be no empty names or values in the right argument.</p> <p> Hint: The partition function \u2286 could be helpful in solving this problem.</p>"},{"location":"2023/6/#examples","title":"Examples:","text":"<pre>      \n      \u2374 \u2395\u2190 ' =' (your_function) 'language=APL dialect=Dyalog' \n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502language\u2502APL   \u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\n\u2502dialect \u2502Dyalog\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n2 2      \n\n      \u2374 \u2395\u2190 ';:' (your_function) 'duck:donald' \n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502duck\u2502donald\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n1 2      \n\n      \u2374 \u2395\u2190 '/:' (your_function) 'name:Morten/name:Brian/name:Ad\u00e1m'\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502name\u2502Morten\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\n\u2502name\u2502Brian \u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\n\u2502name\u2502Ad\u00e1m  \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n3 2\n</pre> <code>your_function \u2190 </code> \u2714 Test"},{"location":"2023/6/#solutions","title":"Solutions","text":"Click to load video from YouTube.
